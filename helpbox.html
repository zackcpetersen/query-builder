<p>Here is some terminology used in this document.</p>
<ul>
    <li>SPREADSHEET is the entire Spreadsheet document, can contain multiple SHEETS and lots of cells / data</li>
    <li>SHEET is a tab within the SPREADSHEET. There can be many SHEETS in a single SPREADSHEET</li>
    <li>DRIVE is your Google Drive - where you can store other SPREADSHEETS</li>
    <li>QUERY is the SQL-like Query where all the magic happens</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to use:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pick the SPREADSHEET you would like to run your Query against - (Use current SPREADSHEET, Select a SPREADSHEET from your Drive)</li>
    <li>Insert a range in that SPREADSHEET - Insert the Sheet name, followed by an explanation point (!) and then the cells you wish to include - (Sheet1!A:Z, MySheet!A200:B300, etc..)</li>
    <li>Select the columns you would like to be included in the Query - you can use a star (*) to select all of them, or a list of the columns you would like to include separated by commas (A,B,C,D)</li>
    <li>Now click “Add New Filter” - here, you’ll need to add one of the columns that you included in the previous step - only use ONE per filter (A).</li>
    <li>Then you’ll choose a comparison operator - do you want the value to equal (=), not equal (!=), be greater than (>), less than (&lt;) </li>
    <li>Finally, insert the value you would like to compare. Note that =, !=, &lt;, >, &lt;=, >=, can ONLY be used when comparing with numbers, not strings.</li>
    <li>Click “ADD” - Congratulations! You’ve made your first filter! Now you can “Add New Filter” again, and they will be used together for more advanced Queries, or click “CREATE QUERY” and you’re done.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Common Issues</h4>
<p>Make sure your data types are the same! If one of your filters is A = 1, make sure that in the sheet, 1 is set to either “Automatic” or “Number.”</p>
<p>If your query is for data in another sheet in your drive, you’ll need to swap the column labels (A, B, C, D) with their numbers (Col1, Col2, Col3, Col4)</p>
